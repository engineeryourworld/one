This is a Design of Experiments lesson

Act 1
Ask teams the report ideas they researched
As teams share, write the ideas on the board
Teacher note: We want as many unique ideas on the board as possible.  Keep all ideas for now, even if they are precluded by constraints.  If a group's top idea has already been reported, ask them to submit their next favorite idea.
Act 2
Ask the class: "Which of these ideas are NOT options for us to test?"
Eliminate ideas that are not possible or too expensive
Teacher note: Eliminate things that are precluded by the constraints, such as modifying beam materials or using different glue. Steer students away from crazy ideas that are not feasible in this class (but reward them for their creativity).
Teacher note: A good isolation mechanism may be a big challenge to do without excellent materials and metal shop tools. You may let students try it, but expect that it will require more teacher guidance.
Teacher note: If you allow students to incorporate materials other than balsa wood, then you will need to attach a cost to those materials.

Act 3:
Ask the class: "Can we test all combinations of these ideas?"
Ask the class: "What should we do, since we can't test everything?"
Tell the class we will divide and conquer.  Each team will test one variable and get data for the class
Let each team choose one variable.  Make sure each team is assigned a different variable to get maximum test coverage.
Show the class what each team is responsible for producing (slide)
Make a blank copy of this spreadsheet available for your students to add their data (sheet)
Teacher note: Students should realize that they could use a Design of Experiments here. However, since the class list should still include several ideas, a full DoE is not feasible. (For example, if the class list includes 6 factors and each must be tested with and without roof load, that will require 2^7 or 128 different cases. This would take too long!).
Teacher note: For alternatives testing strategies, read the follow-up discussions below.
