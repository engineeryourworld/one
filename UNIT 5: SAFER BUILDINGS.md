If your students learn only one thing in this unit, make sure they understand that **valid engineering claims require evidence and reasoning**. The evidence must be appropriate/sufficient and the reasoning must be based on scientific/mathematical principles.


All lessons are 1 day (50 min) unless otherwise stated.

#### BEFORE YOU BEGIN
* Forming Groups
* Careers Research Project
* Pretest

#### IDENTIFY: Analyze interview statements from stakeholders and develop a “know/need-to-know” list.
1.	[Who is your customer and what do they really want?](/lessons/safer%20buildings/who%20is%20your%20customer%20and%20what%20do%20they%20really%20want.md) *(2 days)*

#### DESCRIBE: Develop requirements and constraints. Design an experiment to collect baseline data from scale models of buildings. Build and test scale models. Analyze data to quantify building safety.
2.	Is the client data correct?
3.	Is our data good?
4.	What does an earthquake feel like?
5.	Why are some buildings destroyed while others are not?
6.	What does safe mean?

#### GENERATE: Research existing solutions. Design and conduct an experiment to test some solutions. Compile class data set used to generate concepts for a final design. Select a concept using Six Thinking Hats.
7.	How have engineers prevented damage and death in the past?*
8.	How well do these different ideas work? *(3 days)*
9.	What design should we choose?*

#### EMBODY: Build and test the selected concept, analyze data to quantify safety, determine total cost and cost-to-performance ratio, and refine the concept.
10.	How well does our design perform?

#### FINALIZE: Prepare and submit a written proposal/report. Prepare and present recommendations.
11.	Which proposal has the best cost/performance ratio?
12.	How should we report our recommendations?


#### WRAPPING UP
* Reflecting on groups: peer assessment and self-assessment
* Post-test
* Presenting careers research findings
