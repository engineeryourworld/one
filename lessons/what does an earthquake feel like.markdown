Act 1: Premise
Play the above videos

Act 2: Conflict
Ask your class: "How does the app know it is feeling an earthquake and not another type of movement?"
Ask students to explain their reasoning. Encourage debate
Guide students toward a discussion about how the different movements will have unique characteristics
Teacher note: Instead of asking this question, you can ask students what questions they have after watching the video.
Act 3: Conflict Resolution
Ask students to go to www.menti.com and use the code 21 22 09 (slide)
"How are the movements from these five activities different?"
Show the composite results (chart)
Is the composite class answer reasonable? Did anyone change their mind?
Tell students the app analyzes the movements based on frequency and acceleration. Make sure everyone has the same understanding of those concepts
Ask students who answered very differently to share their thinking
Teacher note: The app has a 99.7% successful rate for distinguishing earthquakes from certain typical human activities
Teacher note: How the app works
Teacher note: What the data from the app looks like
Teacher note: What is frequency exactly?
Act 4: Resolution
Show your students the answer (slide)
Compare the student guesses in Act 2 to the actual answer
Ask your class: Are there any surprises?
