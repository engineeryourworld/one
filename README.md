Technology changes
* We eliminated the use of "smart" file names because the cons outweigh the pros
* Piazza has replaced Canvas as the "hub" of the curriculum
* Files are now in Google Docs format instead of Microsoft Office format
* Teacher notes are now in Piazza instead of on PDFs
* The curriculum is controlled from the teacher notes (Piazza) instead of PowerPoint
* All slides have been consolidated in a single file
* Slides are used only if it saves the teacher time by reducing writing  (e.g., long lists, activity diagrams, pictures, etc.) or automating a task (e.g., announcements, timing, etc).
* We limited clip art to basic shapes and silhouettes only
* Photos are displayed edge-to-edge
 
Advantages of Piazza and Google Drive
* Search
 
Pedagogical changes
* If we already know what we want, we do not ask students to guess (e.g., seismic spectrum, floor loads, etc.)
* All lessons are built around one of several lesson types.  We repeat these lesson types so you can get better at them throughout the year.
* We provide links to pedagogical resources so you can improve your craft
* The structure of the curriculum has been built to match teacher workflow
* Reduced the dependence on the teacher
 
 
Established Goals:
* Help students feel more powerful by properly using the engineering design process
* Accurately assess students’ learning of the engineering design process
* Reflect on your own teaching of the engineering design process
 
Teachers will be able to independently use their learning to…
* Build a safe environment for students experience and navigate failure
* Extend EYW while honoring the curriculum
* Create and share ancillaries that will help other EYW teachers
* Apply the engineering design process to new situations
* Identify variations of the engineering design process in other industries
* Identify connections beyond the surface
* Solve ambiguous problems not explicitly outlined by the curriculum
* Ask meaningful questions during PD
* Curate their own props to supplement lessons
* Create meaningful final exams
* Identify support opportunities
* Combat misconceptions about engineering
* Self-assess their ability to teach the engineering design process
 
Teachers understand that...
* Engineering is not construction, but an intentional process where design comes before construction
* Experiencing failure in a safe way is critical to learning engineering
* PBL can only be learned by doing PBL as a student
* The EYW curriculum is a guide, not a script
* The EYW curriculum has a very deliberate sequence that builds a big picture
* The engineering design process provides necessary structure to an otherwise random iteration
* Assessing an understanding of a process is different than assessing an understanding of content
* All models are wrong
 
Teachers will keep considering these questions…
* What parts of the curriculum are non-negotiable?
* How can I modify my instructional materials to better suit my class without losing critical processes that my kids will need later?
* How much help do I provide my students?  When do I step in and when do I let students fail?
* What are the components of a well designed product?
* How can I get my administration to understand and support PBL?
* What misconceptions do students have about engineering?
* What does a grade really mean?
* How do you grade individuals in a group project?
* How can I hold individual students accountable for participating in and understanding the design process?
* How do I know students are buying-in to the engineering design process?  And how will I know students can apply the engineering design process to new challenges?
* How do I manage and support student failure?
* How do I make the design challenge hard in the right way? (Alternatively, how do I prevent making design challenges hard in the wrong way?)
 
Teachers will know:
* What proper documentation of the engineering design process looks like
* What materials to provide for their students and buy for the classroom
* How long each lesson will take
* How to anticipate students’ questions and needs based on the sequence of curriculum
* Potential hurdles students will experience during a project
* How to build all supporting equipment (e.g., darkroom)
* The peripheral information that supports each lesson
 
Teachers will be skilled at…
* Managing materials
* Managing notebooks
* Pacing the course (creating and running a schedule)
* Tracking student's’ path through the engineering design process
* Facilitating collaboration and group work
* Removing confounding variables from the lab setups
* Assessing the effectiveness of a written or verbal justification of a design
* Creating grading rubrics with their students
* Identifying and explaining engineering careers that connect to design challenges
* Reporting findings/learnings/concerns to EYW staff
