Distribute the grading rubric (doc)
Ask students to research some of the many solutions that exist for designing earthquake-safe buildings
Ask students to select one (1) existing building, mechanism, or technology that could inspire design ideas and prepare a five (5) minute presentation to share with the class
Teacher note: We are researching existing solutions to seed concept generation. It is often better to brainstorm before researching to avoid stifling creativity or fixating on one solution Here we try a different approach –researching, then brainstorming –because many solutions exist and can provide inspiration. Be aware that students may need to be pushed to think creatively rather than simply implementing a researched solution.
Teacher note: We want students to research a large variety of ideas.  If you think it is necessary to seed ideas, then assign research topics (doc)
