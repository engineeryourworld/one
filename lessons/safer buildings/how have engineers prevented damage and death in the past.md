1. Distribute the grading rubric ([doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gpWnixuSpXGnJ9nkbHGP_2c2-cFt35m0E54pBb7nM84/edit?usp=sharing))
2. Ask students to research some of the many solutions that exist for designing earthquake-safe buildings
3. Ask students to select one (1) existing building, mechanism, or technology that could inspire design ideas and prepare a five (5) minute presentation to share with the class

Teacher note: We are researching existing solutions to seed concept generation. It is often better to brainstorm before researching to avoid stifling creativity or fixating on one solution Here we try a different approach –researching, then brainstorming –because many solutions exist and can provide inspiration. Be aware that students may need to be pushed to think creatively rather than simply implementing a researched solution.

Teacher note: We want students to research a large variety of ideas.  If you think it is necessary to seed ideas, then assign research topics ([doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EA_fQRIut5f-qFD3ND3ocWQimdYC7FDHjVXSoGMcTSA/edit?usp=sharing))
